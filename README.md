# canvas-rain-effect
This is a loop animation that simulates rain using javascript and the html5 canvas.

If you look in the rain.js file, you'll notice it's sloppily coded. There are a ton of useless variables and it's also ridded with comments. I'll probably fix these sometime. I apologize if it's hard to understand for now.
